# Election-voting-system
Project Description: Voting System
This project is a simple Voting System developed using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and MySQL as the backend database. It allows users to interact with an easy-to-use interface to cast votes, manage candidates, and view election results.

The system connects to a MySQL database using JDBC, and includes basic features like vote casting and result display. It's designed to help understand how Java applications can interact with databases to create real-world systems.
